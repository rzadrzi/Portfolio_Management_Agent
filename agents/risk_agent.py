Risk analysis module for financial portfolios.

1.Common Quantitative Methods for Risk Analysis:

    Standard Deviation: 
        Measures the dispersion of an investment's returns from its average, indicating its volatility and associated risk. 
    Value-at-Risk (VaR): 
        Estimates the maximum potential loss over a specific time period at a given confidence level, providing a worst-case scenario outlook. 
    Tracking Error: 
        A measure of active risk, it shows how much a portfolio's returns deviate from its benchmark index. 
    Drawdown: 
        Measures the peak-to-trough decline in a portfolio's value over a specific period, highlighting the magnitude of losses from its highest point. 
    Beta: 
        Quantifies the sensitivity of a portfolio's returns to overall market movements. 
    Correlation Analysis: 
        Examines the relationships between different assets within a portfolio to understand how they move together, which affects diversification and risk. 

        
2.Advanced Analytical Techniques:

    Stress Testing: 
        Involves simulating extreme market events or adverse conditions to gauge the impact on the portfolio's value and identify vulnerabilities. 
    Scenario Analysis: 
        "What-if" analyses that assess the potential impact of various prospective trades, hedges, or market conditions on risk and return. 
    Factor Decomposition: 
        Breaking down portfolio risk into its constituent drivers (e.g., macroeconomic factors) to understand the underlying sources of risk and their relative contributions. 
    Marginal VaR and Component VaR: 
        These tools help to identify which specific positions contribute most to the overall portfolio risk, enabling targeted risk reduction strategies. 

        
3.Qualitative and Strategic Approaches:

    Risk Identification: 
        The first step in risk management, which involves recognizing potential risks associated with investments and market conditions. 
    Weighted Ranking and Scoring Techniques: 
        Used by governing bodies to assess risks by assigning weights and scores, helping to prioritize risks during governance meetings. 
    Portfolio Diversification: 
        A strategic approach to spread investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to reduce the impact of any single underperforming investment. 
    Asset Allocation: 
        A strategy that involves strategically distributing investments across different asset classes to manage risk according to the investor's goals. 
    Hedging: 
        Employing financial instruments or derivatives to offset potential losses in another investment, reducing overall portfolio risk.
