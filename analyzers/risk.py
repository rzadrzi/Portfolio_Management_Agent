1.Common Quantitative Methods for Risk Analysis:

Standard Deviation: 
        Measures the dispersion of an investment's returns from its average, indicating its volatility and associated risk. 
Value-at-Risk (VaR): 
        Estimates the maximum potential loss over a specific time period at a given confidence level, providing a worst-case scenario outlook. 
Tracking Error: 
        A measure of active risk, it shows how much a portfolio's returns deviate from its benchmark index. 
Drawdown: 
        Measures the peak-to-trough decline in a portfolio's value over a specific period, highlighting the magnitude of losses from its highest point. 
Beta: 
        Quantifies the sensitivity of a portfolio's returns to overall market movements. 
Correlation Analysis: 
        Examines the relationships between different assets within a portfolio to understand how they move together, which affects diversification and risk.
